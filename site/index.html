            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game’s objective is simply to retrieve a bag of milk, which in itself may seem like a bizarrely mundane task. But the game’s aesthetic is indicative of how the unnamed young female
                protagonist feels especially hopeless about such a seemingly trivial matter, from the distorted text sound when proceeding with the narrative to the droning, ominous main music played throughout the first scene. It is obvious from the
                start how important our choices are for the sake of our character’s wellbeing. In fact, a bad ending involving a jump scare will quickly end the game if you choose to question their mental state too often or be dismissive of her! In this
                way, the title effectively relays the importance of understanding one another without presuming or judging, and places great importance on how much we value and care about this troubled young girl by the time she opens up about her trauma,
                and finally explains how her anxiety and current mental state came to be.
            </p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s perhaps no surprise when the experience turns out to be quite “meta”; the lead character acknowledges that they are in a game and that “you”, the player, do not exist; instead
                your selections are what part of her happens to be thinking. This is reinforced very effectively with the emphasis on the concept of repetition in the game: as seen everywhere from its title to sequences where your input needs to be retyped
                or selected multiple times. It demonstrates that the girl is clearly uncomfortable with being reassured, as she feels she cannot believe or accept your words. This is a deliberate subversion of visual novel conventions, where choices are
                sacrosanct, and is played around with exceptionally well to express this struggle from both our point of view and hers. Her inner thoughts and value of herself are so critical and full of self-loathing that any encouragement or guidance
                falls on deaf ears, making our perspective feel insignificant and helpless, but also providing a realistic representation of living with mental health issues. This could be due to the girl’s habit of pushing others away due to her trauma
                — or perhaps because her only current relationship is a very distant, poor one with her mother.
